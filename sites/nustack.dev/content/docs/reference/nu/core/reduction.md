Module `nu.core.reduction`.

Reduction atoms: Python's stream-to-scalar builtins.

Maps Python's builtins that fold an iterable down to one value onto Nu
Reductions (a ScalarQuery with a stream child - they bridge the REFUSED cell of
the cardinality matrix by naming the fold). Pure compute over the source.

Builtins covered (Python -> Nu):

- `sum` -> `Sum`, `min` -> `Min`, `max` -> `Max`
- `any` -> `AnyOf`, `all` -> `AllOf`
- `len` over a stream -> `Count`

Plus the structural folds Python reaches for without a single builtin name -
`First` / `Last` / `Collect` - the native ways to take the head, the tail,
or the whole drain of a stream.

`functools.reduce` is stdlib, not a bare builtin, so a generic `Reduce` is
core-adjacent (borderline). It is deferred to `nustd`, not declared here:
core stays the 1:1 map of native builtins.

Every atom is EVALUABLE: each `Reduction` defines `compile` (sync) and
`acompile` (async) returning a thunk that drains its stream child to a scalar,
with EMPTY / INVALID sentinel propagation.

Sorts: all ScalarQuery / Reduction (Q-scalar over Q-stream).

| Name | Sort | Call | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [AllOf](#allof) | `reduction` | `AllOf(stream)` | True if every item in its stream child is truthy (`all`). |
| [AnyOf](#anyof) | `reduction` | `AnyOf(stream)` | True if any item in its stream child is truthy (`any`). |
| [Collect](#collect) | `reduction` | `Collect(stream)` | Drains its stream child into one list value. |
| [Count](#count) | `reduction` | `Count(stream)` | The number of items in its stream child (`len` over a stream). |
| [First](#first) | `reduction` | `First(stream)` | The first item of its stream child. |
| [Last](#last) | `reduction` | `Last(stream)` | The last item of its stream child. |
| [Max](#max) | `reduction` | `Max(stream)` | The largest item in its stream child (`max`). |
| [Min](#min) | `reduction` | `Min(stream)` | The smallest item in its stream child (`min`). |
| [Sum](#sum) | `reduction` | `Sum(stream)` | The sum of every item in its stream child (`sum`). |

## AllOf

True if every item in its stream child is truthy (`all`).

```python
AllOf(stream)
```

Path `nu.core.AllOf`. Kind `Reduction`, sort `reduction`, cardinality `scalar`. Arity 1 (1 required).

**Arguments**

| Name | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stream` |  |  | the stream to fold. |

**Yields**

True or False. INVALID if a sentinel is met before a falsy item.

**Notes**

- Short-circuits on the first falsy item; the rest of the stream is never drained.
- An empty stream yields True, Python's `all` rule for no items.

**Example**

```python
nu.run(nu.AllOf(nu.Iter([1, 1, 1])))[0]
```

```
True
```

## AnyOf

True if any item in its stream child is truthy (`any`).

```python
AnyOf(stream)
```

Path `nu.core.AnyOf`. Kind `Reduction`, sort `reduction`, cardinality `scalar`. Arity 1 (1 required).

**Arguments**

| Name | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stream` |  |  | the stream to fold. |

**Yields**

True or False. INVALID if a sentinel is met before a truthy item.

**Notes**

- Short-circuits on the first truthy item; the rest of the stream is never drained.
- An empty stream yields False, Python's `any` rule for no items.

**Example**

```python
nu.run(nu.AnyOf(nu.Iter([0, 0, 1])))[0]
```

```
True
```

## Collect

Drains its stream child into one list value.

```python
Collect(stream)
```

Path `nu.core.Collect`. Kind `Reduction`, sort `reduction`, cardinality `scalar`. Arity 1 (1 required).

**Arguments**

| Name | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stream` |  |  | the stream to fold. |

**Yields**

A list of every item, in order. Empty list for an empty stream.
INVALID if any item is EMPTY or INVALID.

**Notes**

- The one reduction with no single Python builtin behind it; it names the structural "materialize the stream" fold.

**Example**

```python
nu.run(nu.Collect(nu.Iter([1, 2, 3])))[0]
```

```
[1, 2, 3]
```

## Count

The number of items in its stream child (`len` over a stream).

```python
Count(stream)
```

Path `nu.core.Count`. Kind `Reduction`, sort `reduction`, cardinality `scalar`. Arity 1 (1 required).

**Arguments**

| Name | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stream` |  |  | the stream to fold. |

**Yields**

The count. 0 for an empty stream. INVALID if any item is EMPTY
or INVALID.

**Notes**

- Drains the whole stream to count it; there is no shortcut.

**Example**

```python
nu.run(nu.Count(nu.Iter([1, 2, 3])))[0]
```

```
3
```

## First

The first item of its stream child.

```python
First(stream)
```

Path `nu.core.First`. Kind `Reduction`, sort `reduction`, cardinality `scalar`. Arity 1 (1 required).

**Arguments**

| Name | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stream` |  |  | the stream to fold. |

**Yields**

The first item. EMPTY if the stream is empty, INVALID if that
first item is EMPTY or INVALID.

**Notes**

- Pulls exactly one item and stops; the rest of the stream is never touched.

**Example**

```python
nu.run(nu.First(nu.Iter([1, 2, 3])))[0]
```

```
1
```

## Last

The last item of its stream child.

```python
Last(stream)
```

Path `nu.core.Last`. Kind `Reduction`, sort `reduction`, cardinality `scalar`. Arity 1 (1 required).

**Arguments**

| Name | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stream` |  |  | the stream to fold. |

**Yields**

The last item. EMPTY if the stream is empty, INVALID if any item
is EMPTY or INVALID.

**Notes**

- Drains the whole stream to find the last item; there is no shortcut from the tail.

**Example**

```python
nu.run(nu.Last(nu.Iter([1, 2, 3])))[0]
```

```
3
```

## Max

The largest item in its stream child (`max`).

```python
Max(stream)
```

Path `nu.core.Max`. Kind `Reduction`, sort `reduction`, cardinality `scalar`. Arity 1 (1 required).

**Arguments**

| Name | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stream` |  |  | the stream to fold. |

**Yields**

The largest item. EMPTY if the stream is empty, INVALID if any
item is EMPTY or INVALID.

**Notes**

- Buffers every item before comparing, since finding a maximum needs the whole set; nothing shortcuts.
- An empty stream yields EMPTY, not an error, unlike Python's `max` which raises.

**Example**

```python
nu.run(nu.Max(nu.Iter([3, 1, 2])))[0]
```

```
3
```

## Min

The smallest item in its stream child (`min`).

```python
Min(stream)
```

Path `nu.core.Min`. Kind `Reduction`, sort `reduction`, cardinality `scalar`. Arity 1 (1 required).

**Arguments**

| Name | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stream` |  |  | the stream to fold. |

**Yields**

The smallest item. EMPTY if the stream is empty, INVALID if any
item is EMPTY or INVALID.

**Notes**

- Buffers every item before comparing, since finding a minimum needs the whole set; nothing shortcuts.
- An empty stream yields EMPTY, not an error, unlike Python's `min` which raises.

**Example**

```python
nu.run(nu.Min(nu.Iter([3, 1, 2])))[0]
```

```
1
```

## Sum

The sum of every item in its stream child (`sum`).

```python
Sum(stream)
```

Path `nu.core.Sum`. Kind `Reduction`, sort `reduction`, cardinality `scalar`. Arity 1 (1 required).

**Arguments**

| Name | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stream` |  |  | the stream to fold. |

**Yields**

The sum. INVALID if any item is EMPTY or INVALID.

**Notes**

- Folds from 0, the additive identity, so an empty stream yields 0 rather than EMPTY.
- The fold stops at the first EMPTY or INVALID item it drains.

**Example**

```python
nu.run(nu.Sum(nu.Iter([1, 2, 3])))[0]
```

```
6
```
