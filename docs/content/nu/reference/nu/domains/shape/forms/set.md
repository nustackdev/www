Module `nu.domains.shape.forms.set_`.

Shape-domain Set Form glue: tier-by-tier composition.

SetLikeForm     = generic SetLikeForm + shape CollectionForm
MutableSetForm  = generic MutableSetForm + shape MutableCollectionForm
ReactiveSetForm = generic ReactiveSetForm + shape MutableSetForm
                  + shape ReactiveCollectionForm

The Reactive tier brings together:
  - `on_change()`           from generic ReactiveSetForm (generic)
  - `on_child_change()` etc from shape ReactiveCollectionForm (shape-domain)

| [ReactiveSetForm](#reactivesetform) | `ReactiveSetForm()` | Reactive shape set. Adds on_change + tree-aware on_child_change* family. |
| [SetLikeForm](#setlikeform) | `SetLikeForm()` | Shape set: unordered-unique-element ops + exists/missing/extract. |
