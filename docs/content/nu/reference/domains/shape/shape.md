Module `nu.domains.shape.shape`.

Shape family: a nested Shape in a shape fabric, navigated by slot name.

A Shape is structurally a mapping of its slot names, so the ref wears the
mapping forms. Descent is by name, not by value: `ref.field` and
`ref["field"]` resolve the slot the Shape declared, and that slot builds its
own ref under this one.

| Name | Sort | Call | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [MutableShapeRef](#mutableshaperef) | `ref` | `MutableShapeRef(address, shape_type, parent_ref=None, owner_shape=None)` | Mutable structured container Ref. |
| [ReactiveShapeRef](#reactiveshaperef) | `ref` | `ReactiveShapeRef(address, shape_type, parent_ref=None, owner_shape=None)` | Reactive structured container Ref. |
| [ShapeRef](#shaperef) | `ref` | `ShapeRef(address, shape_type, parent_ref=None, owner_shape=None)` | Structured container Ref; slot navigation via attribute or bracket access. |

## MutableShapeRef

Mutable structured container Ref.

```python
MutableShapeRef(address, shape_type, parent_ref=None, owner_shape=None)
```

Path `nu.domains.shape.MutableShapeRef`. Kind `Ref`, sort `ref`, cardinality `scalar`.

Adds: store(v), erase(), set(k,v), delete(k), update(), ... (from
shape MutableMappingForm) on top of ShapeRef.
