Module `nustd.kv.refs.set`.

Virtuals set reference: unordered unique-element container backed by a View.

| Name | Sort | Call | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [SetRef](#setref) | `ref` | `SetRef(address, item_type, view_type, parent_ref=None, owner_shape=None)` | A set slot in KV storage: unordered, unique elements, stored decomposed. |

## SetRef

A set slot in KV storage: unordered, unique elements, stored decomposed.

```python
SetRef(address, item_type, view_type, parent_ref=None, owner_shape=None)
```

Path `nustd.kv.SetRef`. Kind `Ref`, sort `ref`, cardinality `scalar`.

**Notes**

- Ops run against the live View, so membership and size are answered by storage rather than by reading the set out.
- Elements have no addresses of their own to descend into: a set has no keys, so there is no element ref and no subscript.
- The set algebra (`union`, `intersection`, ...) yields values; the in-place variants (`update`, `difference_update`, ...) are the ones that write.
- Change observation covers the child, the children and the whole subtree, each with its own hook.
- PrimitiveSetRef is the other choice: one opaque blob written whole.

**Example**

```python
class Portfolio(Shape):
    members = SetRef.slot(str)
run(Portfolio.members.add("gor"), ctx)
run(Portfolio.members.contains("gor"), ctx)
```
