Module `nu.domains.shape.forms.sequence`.

Shape-domain Sequence Form glue: tier-by-tier composition.

SequenceForm         = generic SequenceForm + shape CollectionForm
MutableSequenceForm  = generic MutableSequenceForm + shape MutableCollectionForm
ReactiveSequenceForm = generic ReactiveSequenceForm + shape MutableSequenceForm
                       + shape ReactiveCollectionForm

The Reactive tier brings together:
  - `on_change()`           from generic ReactiveSequenceForm (generic)
  - `on_child_change()` etc from shape ReactiveCollectionForm (shape-domain)

| [ReactiveSequenceForm](#reactivesequenceform) | `ReactiveSequenceForm()` | Reactive shape sequence. Adds on_change + tree-aware on_child_change* family. |
| [SequenceForm](#sequenceform) | `SequenceForm()` | Shape sequence: ordered-element ops + exists/missing/extract. |
